# Contributing to K83 Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the K83 Framework! This project aims to revolutionize AI-assisted development by combining AgentOS methodology, intelligent MCP orchestration, and agentic workflows.

## Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
2. **Install K83 in development mode:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork>
   cd k83-framework
   ./install-k83.sh
   ```
3. **Test your changes** with real Claude Code integration
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description

## Project Architecture

### Core Components
- **AgentOS Integration** - Structured development methodology
- **MCP Orchestration** - 25+ premium MCP servers with intelligent routing
- **Agentic Workflows** - Autonomous `/yolo` and `/orchestrate` modes
- **Context Management** - Session preservation across tools/models
- **Claude Code Integration** - Universal slash command interface

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, include type hints
- **Shell Scripts**: Use `set -e`, proper error handling
- **Documentation**: Update README.md for any new features
- **Testing**: Include examples for new slash commands

### MCP Server Integration
When adding new MCP servers:
1. **Verify server exists** and is publicly available
2. **Test installation** in clean environment
3. **Add to orchestration logic** in K83MCPServer
4. **Update documentation** with new capabilities

### Agentic Workflow Design
New autonomous workflows should:
- Use AgentOS three-phase methodology (Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review)
- Include error handling and recovery
- Integrate with context preservation system
- Provide clear success/failure indicators

## Types of Contributions

### üêõ Bug Reports
- Use GitHub Issues with bug report template
- Include steps to reproduce
- Mention your OS and Claude Code version

### ‚ú® Feature Requests
- Describe the use case and value
- Consider how it fits with AgentOS methodology
- Propose integration approach

### üîß Code Contributions
- Start with small, focused changes
- Include tests and documentation updates
- Follow existing code patterns

### üìö Documentation
- Fix typos, improve clarity
- Add usage examples
- Update command references

## MCP Server Contribution Guidelines

### Adding New MCP Servers
1. **Research**: Verify the MCP server is stable and well-maintained
2. **Test**: Ensure it works with Claude Code/Desktop
3. **Integration**: Add to `install-k83.sh` with proper error handling
4. **Orchestration**: Add intelligence routing logic to `K83MCPServer`
5. **Documentation**: Update command reference and examples

### MCP Server Categories
- **Core Framework**: Essential for basic functionality
- **Development Tools**: Code analysis, IDE integration
- **Enterprise Features**: DevOps, security, monitoring
- **Specialized**: AI/ML, data processing, automation

## Testing Your Contributions

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test installation from scratch
rm -rf .k83 .claude
./install-k83.sh

# Test core slash commands in Claude Code
/yolo "simple test task"
/mcp-status
/orchestrate "basic workflow"
```

### Integration Testing
- Test AgentOS workflow integration
- Verify MCP orchestration logic
- Check context preservation across sessions
- Validate error handling and recovery

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create focused commits** with clear messages
2. **Update documentation** for any changes
3. **Test thoroughly** in real environment
4. **Describe changes** clearly in PR description
5. **Link to related issues** if applicable
