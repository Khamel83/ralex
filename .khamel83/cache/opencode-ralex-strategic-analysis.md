# OpenCode.ai vs Ralex Strategic Analysis

## Original Task
Strategic evaluation: Should Ralex continue as independent project or leverage OpenCode.ai foundation?

## Breakdown Strategy

### 1. Planning Phase (Expensive Model)
**Current Analysis - What's Really at Stake:**

#### Beyond YOLO: Full Feature Comparison
- **YOLO Execution**: OpenCode.ai has built-in auto-approve, Ralex requires per-action approval
- **Model Routing**: Ralex has semantic routing + LiteLLM, OpenCode.ai uses standard routing
- **Cost Optimization**: Ralex + Agent-OS has intelligent cost strategies, OpenCode.ai is standard pricing
- **Context Management**: Ralex has file context + memory, OpenCode.ai has standard context
- **Mobile Integration**: Ralex has iOS/OpenCat setup, OpenCode.ai is terminal-only
- **Customization**: Ralex is fully customizable, OpenCode.ai is opinionated framework

#### Strategic Questions
1. **Core Value**: Is Ralex's semantic routing + cost optimization worth maintaining?
2. **Technical Debt**: Is it cheaper to enhance OpenCode.ai or continue Ralex?
3. **User Experience**: Which provides better developer workflow?
4. **Data Strategy**: Can both share the same universal logging system?

#### Risk Assessment
- **Continue Ralex**: Maintain control, unique features, but more development overhead
- **Pivot to OpenCode.ai**: Faster development, but lose custom routing and cost optimization
- **Hybrid Approach**: Layer Ralex features on OpenCode.ai foundation

### 2. Implementation Phases (Cheap Models)

#### Phase A: Universal Data Collection Architecture
- [ ] Design unique ID system for all operations (works for both tools)
- [ ] Create metadata logging schema (prompt_id, cost, model, timestamp, etc.)
- [ ] Implement lightweight logging that doesn't impact performance
- [ ] Build foundation that works regardless of final tool choice

#### Phase B: OpenCode.ai Evaluation POC
- [ ] Install OpenCode.ai and test YOLO functionality
- [ ] Test with Agent-OS cost optimization concepts
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison with current Ralex workflow
- [ ] Document developer experience differences

#### Phase C: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test OpenCode.ai with your existing Agent-OS setup
- [ ] Evaluate if Agent-OS cost optimization can layer on top
- [ ] Test mobile workflow compatibility
- [ ] Performance and cost comparison

### 3. Review Phase (Medium Model)
- Strategic recommendation based on evaluation data
- Cost-benefit analysis of each approach
- Migration path recommendation if pivot needed
- Data collection validation for future optimization

## Key Insights for Decision

### Data-First Architecture
- Design logging system that works for ANY tool choice
- Unique IDs + metadata for everything
- Cheap to collect, valuable later for optimization
- Foundation for future cost analysis regardless of tool

### Strategic Options
1. **Pure Ralex**: Keep building, add YOLO mode
2. **Pure OpenCode.ai**: Pivot completely, lose custom features
3. **Hybrid**: OpenCode.ai core + Ralex features as layer
4. **Parallel**: Both tools for different use cases

### Success Metrics
- Developer productivity improvement
- Cost reduction effectiveness
- Setup/maintenance overhead
- Feature completeness for your workflow

## Next Steps
Execute implementation phases to gather real data for strategic decision.
