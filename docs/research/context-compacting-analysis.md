# Context Compacting Analysis

This document outlines the research and proposed architecture for implementing context compacting in Ralex.

## Research Findings

Based on a web search, there are two primary approaches to text summarization in Python:

*   **Extractive Summarization:** This method identifies and extracts the most important sentences from the original text. It is generally faster and less computationally expensive. The `Sumy` library is a popular and straightforward choice for this approach.
*   **Abstractive Summarization:** This method generates new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text. It is more complex and computationally expensive, but can produce more human-like summaries. The `Hugging Face Transformers` library provides access to state-of-the-art models for this approach.

## Proposed Architecture

I propose a hybrid approach that uses both extractive and abstractive summarization, depending on the context and the user's needs.

1.  **Extractive Summarization for Short-Term Context:** For summarizing the last few turns of a conversation, an extractive approach using `Sumy` would be sufficient. This would be fast and efficient, and would provide a good overview of the recent conversation history.
2.  **Abstractive Summarization for Long-Term Context:** For summarizing long documents or entire conversation histories, an abstractive approach using a model from `Hugging Face Transformers` would be more appropriate. This would produce a more concise and readable summary, which would be more useful for long-term context.

This hybrid approach would provide a good balance between performance and quality, and would allow us to tailor the summarization process to the specific needs of the user.
