## AI Response
Sure, here's a clean `calculator.py` file with `add` and `multiply` functions:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers and returns the result.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number to add.
        b (float): The second number to add.

    Returns:
        float: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number to multiply.
        b (float): The second number to multiply.

    Returns:
        float: The product of the two numbers.
    """
    return a * b
```

This code defines two functions, `add` and `multiply`, which perform the respective operations on two input numbers and return the result. The functions also include docstrings that provide a brief description of the function, its parameters, and its return value.

You can use this `calculator.py` file in your other Python scripts by importing the functions like this:

```python
from calculator import add, multiply

result_add = add(5, 3)
print(result_add)  # Output: 8

result_multiply = multiply(4, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output: 24
```

This way, you can easily use the `add` and `multiply` functions from the `calculator.py` file in your other code.

## Execution Result
{'success': True, 'output': 'Created calculator.py', 'details': {'stdout': 'Successfully wrote to calculator.py', 'stderr': '', 'returncode': 0}}
