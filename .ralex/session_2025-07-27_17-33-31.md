## Model Selected
gpt-4

## AI Response
To bring clarity to how we would refactor the complex architecture you are referring to, it would be best if we could see a specific project. However, that is not possible, so here's a general approach on how you could go about doing it:

1. Breaking down monoliths: Before you start refactoring, start identifying functionalities and services within your current system that can be isolated. Such functionalities or services could be user management, transaction processing, notifications, etc.

2. Service isolation: After identifying the services, the next step is to decouple them from your current architecture and create separate services for each function. Each of these services should have its own database to ensure that they can function independently. This makes sure that the failure of one service doesn't affect the others.

3. API Gateway: Implement an API Gateway that acts as a single point of entry into your system. The gateway will route requests to appropriate microservices. It also provides other cross-cutting concerns like authentication/authorization, fault tolerance, service discovery etc.

4. Event-driven architecture: Implementing an event-driven architecture can help increase the efficiency of your system. It ensures data consistency across multiple services and helps manage real-time state updates.

5. Distributed tracing: A critical component of a microservices architecture is the ability to trace requests across multiple services. Distributed tracing tools can provide valuable insights into bottlenecks and point out any performance issues.

6. Deploy with Containers: Wrapping your microservices in containers can greatly simplify deployment and scaling processes. A container orchestration platform like Kubernetes can automate deployment, scaling, and management of these containers.

7. Use CI/CD pipelines: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment is vital for maintaining and updating microservices. Automated pipelines help to ensure all code is tested and makes it easy to release new updates and patches.

Remember, it is crucial to gauge your capacity to manage microservices before refactoring. The move to microservices should be considered a strategic one and ought to align with your business goals.
