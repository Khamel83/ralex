## AI Response
Here's a simple example of a `config.json` file with database settings:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "database": "your_database_name"
  }
}
```

This `config.json` file contains a single object with a `database` property, which holds the necessary database connection settings. Here's what each property represents:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
- `port`: The port number on which the database server is listening.
- `user`: The username to use when connecting to the database.
- `password`: The password for the specified user.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.

You can use this `config.json` file in your application to retrieve the database connection details and connect to the database. For example, in a Node.js application, you could read the contents of the `config.json` file and use the database settings to establish a connection to the database.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Read the config.json file
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));

// Use the database settings to connect to the database
const { host, port, user, password, database } = config.database;
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host,
  port,
  user,
  password,
  database
});
```

This is just a basic example, and you can expand the `config.json` file to include additional settings or configuration options as needed for your application.

## Execution Result
{'success': True, 'output': 'Created config.json', 'details': {'stdout': 'Successfully wrote to config.json', 'stderr': '', 'returncode': 0}}
