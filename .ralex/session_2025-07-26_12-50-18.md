## AI Response
Certainly! Here's an example of a `config.json` file that contains database settings:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "database": "your_database_name"
  }
}
```

This `config.json` file includes the following database settings:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
- `port`: The port number that the database server is listening on.
- `user`: The username to use when connecting to the database.
- `password`: The password to use when connecting to the database.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.

You can use this configuration file in your application to connect to the database. For example, you could read the settings from the `config.json` file and use them to establish a connection to the database using a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.

Here's an example of how you might use the configuration settings in a Node.js application with the `pg` library (a popular PostgreSQL driver for Node.js):

```javascript
const { Client } = require('pg');
const fs = require('fs');

// Load the configuration file
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));

// Create a new PostgreSQL client with the configuration settings
const client = new Client({
  host: config.database.host,
  port: config.database.port,
  user: config.database.user,
  password: config.database.password,
  database: config.database.database
});

// Connect to the database
client.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error connecting to the database:', err);
    return;
  }

  console.log('Connected to the database!');

  // Perform database operations here
  // ...

  // Disconnect from the database
  client.end();
});
```

This example reads the configuration settings from the `config.json` file and uses them to create a new PostgreSQL client. It then connects to the database, performs some operations, and disconnects from the database.
