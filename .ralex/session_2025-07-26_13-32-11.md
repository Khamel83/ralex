## AI Response
Sure, here's a simple `test.py` file:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_add()
    print("All tests passed!")
```

This file defines a simple `add` function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. It also defines a `test_add` function that performs three test cases to ensure the `add` function works as expected.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is used to run the tests when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module). When you run this script, it will execute the `test_add` function and print a message indicating that all tests have passed.

You can save this file as `test.py` and run it from the command line using the following command:

```
python test.py
```

This will execute the tests and display the output:

```
All tests passed!
```

You can add more test cases or modify the existing ones to test the `add` function further.

## Execution Result
{'success': True, 'output': 'Created test.py', 'details': {'stdout': 'Successfully wrote to test.py', 'stderr': '', 'returncode': 0}}
