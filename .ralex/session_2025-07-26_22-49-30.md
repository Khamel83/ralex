## AI Response
Certainly! Here's how you can create a `hello.py` file with a print statement:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, etc.).
2. In the text editor, type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

3. Save the file with the name `hello.py`. Make sure to save it in a location where you can easily access it.

That's it! You have now created a `hello.py` file with a simple print statement that will output "Hello, world!" when you run the script.

To run the script, you can open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.py` file, and then type the following command:

```
python hello.py
```

This will execute the Python script and display the output "Hello, world!" in the terminal or command prompt.

## Execution Result
{'success': True, 'output': 'Created hello.py', 'details': {'stdout': 'Successfully wrote to hello.py', 'stderr': '', 'returncode': 0}}
