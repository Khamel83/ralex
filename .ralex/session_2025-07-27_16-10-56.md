## AI Response
Refactoring complex code architecture involves various steps:

1. **Understanding the code**: The first step is to understand how the existing code works. This may involve spending hours reading the code, understanding the flow, and making lots of notes.

2. **Identify areas for improvement**: Look for areas such as large methods/classes, duplicate code, tight coupling, or areas with lots of bugs.

3. **Define requirements**: If the architecture of a system changes, it probably also has an impact on its requirements. Don't forget to define them in detail to see the big picture.

4. **Choose appropriate design patterns**: Design patterns can simplify complex code by providing proven solutions for common problems.

5. **Break down the refactoring into small tasks**: Rather than trying to refactor the entire codebase at once, break it down into manageable tasks.

6. **Write Tests**: Before starting your refactoring process, make sure you have a safety net by writing tests covering the code you want to refactor.

7. **Constant Refactoring**: Don’t spend weeks or months on refactoring efforts. Refactor in small steps, and commit the code after each step.

8. **Code Review and Quality Inspection**: After refactoring is complete, the code should be reviewed and tested for quality assurance.

9. **Documentation**: Don't forget to document the changes made and the new architecture. Update the system and design documentation as needed.

Always remember, if functionality of software is not improving significantly, refactoring may not be justified as it involves time, opportunity costs, and carries a risk of introducing new bugs.
