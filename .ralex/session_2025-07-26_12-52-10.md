## AI Response
Here's a simple HTML page with a form:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Simple Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Contact Us</h1>
  <form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

    <label for="message">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the HTML page includes a simple form with three input fields:

1. **Name**: A text input field for the user to enter their name.
2. **Email**: An email input field for the user to enter their email address.
3. **Message**: A textarea field for the user to enter their message.

The `required` attribute is added to each input field to ensure that the user fills out all the required fields before submitting the form.

The `<button type="submit">Send</button>` element is used to submit the form when the user clicks it.

You can customize this form further by adding additional fields, styling the elements with CSS, or adding client-side or server-side validation as needed.
