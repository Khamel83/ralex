## AI Response
Debugging a memory leak in an application involves several steps. 

1. **Identifying the Issue**: The first step is to identify if there is indeed a memory leak. This can be done by monitoring the system’s resources. If the application continues to consume more and more memory over time without freeing it up, even after its tasks are complete, then there’s likely a memory leak. 

2. **Use Profiling Tools**: Use profiling or diagnostic tools to identify memory leaks. These tools differ based on the programming language and platform you are working on. For C and C++, tools such as Valgrind or Dr. Memory can be used. For Java, you can use Java's built-in tool JVisualVM, and for JavaScript, Chrome Developer Tools has a dedicated memory tab. 

3. **Analyzing the Results**: Once the profiling tool pinpoints the potential memory leaks, analyze the results. This usually points out the class or even the exact object that is causing the memory leak.

4. **Fixing Code**: After determining the exact location of the memory leak, you can now proceed to tackle the issue in the code. This may involve fixing the misuse of memory management, including over-retention, under-retention, or memory that never gets released. 

5. **Testing**: After fixing the suspected code, test to make sure the memory leak is indeed fixed. Use the same profiling tools to monitor the application's memory usage. 

6. **Code Review and Preventive Measures**: Once everything is resolved, do a thorough code review to find any similar patterns that might cause leaks in the future. Also, ensure you are following best practices for memory management to avoid possible leaks in future.

Remember that debugging a memory leak can be a complex process, and sometimes it requires a deep understanding of the language's memory management system to solve the issue. Follow the best practices and strategies to prevent memory leaks.
