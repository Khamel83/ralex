## 2025-08-07: Initial K83 Framework Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, AI Development Team

### Decision

K83 will be implemented as a Claude Code native MCP server that provides slash commands for Agent OS methodology, agentic workflows, and universal tool integration.

### Context

The original concept involved complex CLI tools and external environment management. Analysis showed this created friction and reduced adoption. The goal is seamless AI development experience with zero external tool management.

### Rationale

- **Claude Code Native Integration** - Users get full functionality without leaving their primary development environment
- **Slash Command Interface** - Intuitive, discoverable commands that feel natural in conversational AI
- **MCP Server Architecture** - Leverages existing MCP ecosystem while providing unified orchestration
- **Agent OS Foundation** - Builds on proven methodology rather than inventing new approaches

## 2025-08-07: Universal MCP Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Integration Team

### Decision

K83 will integrate and orchestrate 6 essential MCP servers (GitHub, FileSystem, Memory Bank, Sequential Thinking, Database, Web Testing) rather than building custom equivalents.

### Context

Building custom implementations would duplicate existing, well-tested MCP servers. The value is in orchestration and intelligent coordination, not reimplementation.

### Rationale

- **Leverage Existing Quality** - MCP servers are battle-tested and feature-complete
- **Focus on Orchestration** - K83's value is in intelligent coordination, not individual tool functionality  
- **Ecosystem Compatibility** - Works with existing MCP infrastructure and future additions
- **Faster Development** - Avoids rebuilding existing functionality

## 2025-08-07: Agent OS Methodology Adoption

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product Strategy
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

K83 will fully adopt buildermethods/agent-os methodology as the foundation for all development workflows, with custom extensions for agentic and MCP-aware patterns.

### Context

Agent OS provides proven spec-driven development methodology. Rather than creating competing methodology, enhance and extend Agent OS for K83's unique capabilities.

### Rationale

- **Proven Methodology** - Agent OS has demonstrated success in structured AI development
- **Community Adoption** - Leverages existing Agent OS community and knowledge
- **Consistent Experience** - Users familiar with Agent OS can immediately use K83
- **Evolutionary Approach** - Enhance rather than replace successful patterns

## 2025-08-07: Agentic Workflow Design Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** User Experience
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Design, Development Team

### Decision

Agentic workflows (`/yolo`, `/orchestrate`) will follow Agent OS methodology phases but execute autonomously with intelligent error handling and iterative improvement.

### Context

Pure autonomous coding often produces inconsistent results. Pure manual coding loses efficiency benefits. Need balance between structure and automation.

### Rationale

- **Structured Autonomy** - Agent OS methodology provides guardrails for autonomous execution
- **Iterative Improvement** - Automatic error detection and fixing maintains quality
- **User Override** - Users can intervene at any point without losing progress
- **Transparent Process** - Users see each phase of Agent OS methodology being executed

## 2025-08-07: Context Preservation Architecture

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, AI Integration Team

### Decision

Context will be preserved using hybrid approach: SQLite for structured state, Markdown files for human-readable context, Git for versioning and collaboration.

### Context

Different context types have different optimal storage methods. Users need both machine-readable state and human-readable summaries.

### Rationale

- **SQLite for State** - Fast queries, relationships, structured data
- **Markdown for Readability** - Human-readable, version-controllable, portable
- **Git for Versioning** - Established collaboration and history patterns
- **Hybrid Approach** - Each storage method used for its strengths

## 2025-08-07: One-Command Installation Philosophy  

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** User Experience  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Installation Team

### Decision

K83 installation will be a single `curl` command that sets up everything needed for immediate use with zero manual configuration.

### Context

Complex installation processes reduce adoption and create support burden. Users want to start using functionality immediately.

### Rationale

- **Zero Friction Adoption** - Eliminates barriers to trying K83
- **Immediate Value** - Users see results within minutes of installation
- **Auto-Detection** - System intelligently configures based on project context
- **Self-Updating** - Stays current with Agent OS and MCP improvements
