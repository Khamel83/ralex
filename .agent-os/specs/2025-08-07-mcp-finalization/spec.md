# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MCP Centralization Finalization
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Finalize the MCP centralization system to production-ready status with comprehensive testing, error handling, health checks, and proper Agent-OS integration. The current system is approximately 95% complete with core functionality working but lacks the robustness, testing, and monitoring capabilities required for production deployment. This spec transforms the existing codebase into a maintainable, reliable solution with proper error handling, comprehensive test coverage, and health monitoring.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want a reliable MCP installation system that handles edge cases gracefully, provides clear error messages, and can recover from failures automatically, so that I can deploy MCP servers confidently across different environments.

**As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive health monitoring and logging capabilities that allow me to track system status, diagnose issues quickly, and maintain optimal performance of all MCP services.

**As an end user**, I want the MCP system to be robust and self-healing, with automatic error recovery and clear status reporting, so that my development workflow is never interrupted by infrastructure issues.

## Spec Scope

- Fix installation timing and dependency issues in the setup scripts
- Implement comprehensive testing suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the system
- Implement health checks and monitoring for all MCP services
- Create comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Ensure proper Agent-OS integration and workflow compatibility
- Add logging and telemetry for system observability
- Implement graceful degradation and failover capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Major architectural changes to the core MCP centralization design
- Addition of new MCP servers beyond those already implemented
- User interface modifications or new UI components
- Performance optimizations beyond basic reliability improvements
- Integration with external monitoring systems (beyond basic health checks)

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready MCP centralization system featuring:
- Rock-solid installation script with comprehensive error handling
- Complete testing suite with >90% code coverage
- Health monitoring dashboard and alerting system
- Detailed documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Automated recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Performance monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Agent-OS workflow integration verification
