# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-07-mcp-finalization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-07
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Installation System Improvements
- **Dependency Resolution**: Implement proper dependency checking and installation ordering
- **Timing Controls**: Add configurable delays and retry mechanisms for service startup
- **Environment Detection**: Auto-detect system capabilities and adapt installation accordingly
- **Rollback Capability**: Implement transaction-like installation with rollback on failure
- **Configuration Validation**: Validate all configuration files before service startup

### Testing Framework Implementation
- **Unit Testing**: Jest-based unit tests for all JavaScript modules, pytest for Python components
- **Integration Testing**: Docker-based integration tests for complete system workflows
- **End-to-End Testing**: Automated tests simulating real-world usage scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for concurrent MCP server operations
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Specific tests for failure modes and recovery mechanisms

### Health Monitoring System
- **Service Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for each MCP server with detailed status reporting
- **System Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking
- **Connection Health**: Monitor all MCP client-server connections with automatic reconnection
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for service failures and resource thresholds
- **Dashboard Interface**: Web-based status dashboard with real-time metrics

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality during partial failures
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Configurable retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures in MCP server communications
- **Error Logging**: Structured logging with severity levels and correlation IDs
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic restart of failed services with exponential backoff

## Approach

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Week 1)
1. Fix immediate installation issues identified in current system
2. Implement basic error handling and logging infrastructure
3. Add simple health check endpoints for all services
4. Create foundation testing framework with basic unit tests

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (Week 2)
1. Develop complete unit test suite for all components
2. Implement integration testing with Docker-based test environment
3. Create end-to-end testing scenarios covering major workflows
4. Add performance and stress testing capabilities

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 3)
1. Implement advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
2. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
3. Create health dashboard and administrative interfaces
4. Complete documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Testing Strategy
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests before implementing fixes to ensure regression prevention
- **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline running all tests on every commit
- **Environment Parity**: Testing environments mirror production configuration exactly
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain minimum 90% test coverage with quality gate enforcement

## External Dependencies

### Development Tools
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **Pytest**: Python testing framework for server-side components
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration for integration testing
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage (optional, basic implementation)
- **Node.js HTTP Server**: Simple health check endpoints and status dashboard
- **SQLite**: Local storage for health check history and system logs

### System Requirements
- **Node.js 18+**: Required for MCP server runtime and testing tools
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for Python-based MCP servers and testing
- **Docker**: Required for containerized testing and optional deployment
- **Git**: Version control and CI/CD integration
