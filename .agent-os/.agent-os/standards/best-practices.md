# Atlas Standards: Best Practices

This document outlines general best practices for development within the Atlas project. These guidelines aim to promote maintainable, scalable, and robust code.

## General Development

- **Modularity**: Design components to be small, focused, and reusable.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Where applicable, write tests before writing the code they test.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging.
- **Security**: Consider security implications at every stage of development.
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance where necessary, but prioritize clarity and correctness first.

## Data Management

- **Data Validation**: Always validate input data at the earliest possible point.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency and prevent corruption.
- **Data Privacy**: Handle personal data with care and adhere to privacy principles.

## Version Control (Git)

- **Atomic Commits**: Make small, self-contained commits that address a single logical change.
- **Clear Commit Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages that explain *why* a change was made, not just *what* was changed.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use a clear branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow).
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct code reviews for all changes to ensure quality and knowledge sharing.

## Documentation

- **READMEs**: Maintain up-to-date README files for the project and significant sub-modules.
- **Inline Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- **API Documentation**: Document all APIs clearly, including endpoints, parameters, and responses.

## Dependency Management

- **Pin Dependencies**: Pin exact versions of dependencies to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Example (Commit Message)

```
feat: Add user authentication via OpenRouter

This commit introduces user authentication using the OpenRouter API.
Users can now register and log in, and their sessions are managed via JWTs.

Addresses #123
