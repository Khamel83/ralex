# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the security best practices to be followed throughout the development and deployment of the TrojanHorse system. Adhering to these practices is crucial for protecting user data, maintaining system integrity, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

## Principles

- **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every phase of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
- **Least Privilege:** Components and users should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions.
- **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security controls to protect against various threats.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review code, configurations, and deployed systems for security vulnerabilities.
- **Transparency & Accountability:** Log security-relevant events and ensure accountability for security-related actions.

## Data Security

### 1. Data at Rest

- **Encryption:** Sensitive data stored on disk (e.g., transcribed audio, database files) should be encrypted. Leverage OS-level encryption (e.g., macOS FileVault) or application-level encryption where appropriate.
- **Access Control:** Restrict file system permissions to ensure only authorized processes and users can access sensitive data directories.
- **Backup Security:** Ensure backups of sensitive data are also encrypted and stored securely.

### 2. Data in Transit

- **Encryption:** All data transmitted over networks (e.g., during multi-device sync, API calls) must be encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
- **Secure Protocols:** Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for all network interactions.

### 3. Data Handling

- **PII Redaction:** Implement robust PII detection and redaction mechanisms (as per the Privacy Architecture spec) before sending data to external services (e.g., cloud AI).
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect and retain data that is strictly necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Secure Deletion:** Implement secure deletion practices for sensitive data when it is no longer needed.

## Application Security

### 1. Input Validation

- **Principle:** Never trust user input. Validate all inputs at the earliest possible point to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
- **Techniques:** Use whitelisting, regular expressions, and type checking for validation.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **Strong Authentication:** For any API or administrative interfaces, use strong, multi-factor authentication where possible.
- **Secure Credential Storage:** Store API keys, tokens, and other credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration management, not hardcoded).
- **Authorization Checks:** Implement granular authorization checks to ensure users/components can only access resources they are permitted to.

### 3. Dependency Management

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`, `Snyk`).
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Promptly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.

### 4. Error Handling & Logging

- **Secure Error Messages:** Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive system information, stack traces, or internal details to users.
- **Security Logging:** Log security-relevant events (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, data modification) and monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

## System & Infrastructure Security

### 1. Operating System Security

- **Hardening:** Follow OS hardening guidelines (e.g., disable unnecessary services, keep OS updated).
- **Firewall:** Configure firewalls to restrict network access to only necessary ports and services.

### 2. Network Security

- **Segmentation:** Isolate different components of the system using network segmentation where appropriate.
- **Secure Communication:** Ensure all internal and external communication channels are secured.

### 3. Software Updates

- **Regular Patching:** Keep all software components, including the operating system, libraries, and application code, regularly patched and updated.

## Development Practices

- **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on security vulnerabilities.
- **Static Analysis (SAST):** Use static application security testing tools to identify potential security flaws in the code during development.
- **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):** Use dynamic application security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities in the running application.

## Incident Response

- **Plan:** Develop an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches or incidents.
- **Communication:** Establish clear communication channels for security incidents.
