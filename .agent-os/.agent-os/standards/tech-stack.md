# Atlas Standards: Technology Stack

This document outlines the preferred technology stack for the Atlas project. While the core technologies are already established (Python, FastAPI, OpenRouter), this section can be expanded to include specific libraries, frameworks, or tools that are consistently used or recommended within the project.

## Programming Languages

- **Python**: Primary language for backend logic and data processing.

## Frameworks & Libraries

- **FastAPI**: For building robust and efficient APIs.
- **OpenRouter**: For LLM access.

## Databases

- *To be defined based on project needs.*

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Target Environment**: Raspberry Pi (primary), Mac Mini M4 (for intensive tasks).
- **Containerization**: *Consider Docker for consistent environments.*

## Version Control

- **Git**: Standard for version control.

## Other Tools & Services

- *Add any other essential tools here (e.g., specific data processing libraries, monitoring tools, etc.).*
