# Error Handling Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the guidelines for consistent and effective error handling within the TrojanHorse project. Proper error handling is crucial for system stability, maintainability, and providing clear feedback to users and developers.

## Principles

- **Fail Fast, Fail Loudly (during development):** In development environments, unhandled exceptions should ideally crash the process to quickly identify issues.
- **Graceful Degradation (in production):** In production, the system should aim to recover from errors gracefully where possible, or fail in a controlled manner that minimizes impact on users.
- **Informative Errors:** Error messages should be clear, concise, and provide enough information for debugging without exposing sensitive data.
- **Centralized Handling:** Where appropriate, errors should be handled at a higher level to avoid repetitive code and ensure consistency.
- **Logging:** All errors should be logged with appropriate severity levels.

## Types of Errors

### 1. Expected Errors (Exceptions)

- **Definition:** Conditions that are anticipated and can be handled programmatically (e.g., file not found, invalid input, network timeout).
- **Handling:** Use `try-except` blocks to catch specific exceptions.
- **Best Practices:**
    - Catch the most specific exception first.
    - Avoid bare `except:` clauses; always specify the exception type.
    - Log the exception with `logging.error` or `logging.exception`.
    - Provide meaningful error messages to the user (if applicable) or return appropriate error codes/responses.
    - Consider retries for transient errors (e.g., network issues).

### 2. Unexpected Errors (Bugs/System Failures)

- **Definition:** Conditions that are not anticipated and indicate a defect in the code or an unrecoverable system issue (e.g., `IndexError`, `TypeError`, out-of-memory).
- **Handling:** These should typically lead to program termination in development to expose the bug. In production, they should be caught by a top-level error handler that logs the full traceback and potentially notifies administrators.
- **Best Practices:**
    - Do not suppress these errors.
    - Ensure comprehensive logging of the traceback.
    - Implement global exception handlers where appropriate (e.g., for API endpoints, background processes).

## Error Logging

- **Severity:** Use appropriate logging levels:
    - `ERROR`: For recoverable errors or issues that prevent a specific operation from completing.
    - `CRITICAL`: For unrecoverable errors that lead to application termination or significant data loss.
    - `WARNING`: For potential issues that don't immediately break functionality but might indicate a problem.
- **Context:** Always include relevant context in log messages (e.g., input parameters, state of variables, user ID).
- **Tracebacks:** Always log full tracebacks for exceptions using `logging.exception()` or `traceback.format_exc()`.

## User Feedback

- **Clarity:** Error messages presented to the user should be clear, user-friendly, and actionable.
- **Avoid Technical Jargon:** Do not expose internal error details or stack traces to end-users.
- **Correlation IDs:** Consider using correlation IDs for requests to help trace errors across logs.

## Examples (Python)

```python
import logging

# Configure logging (as per Observability Strategy)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def process_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        # Process content
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return False
    except PermissionError:
        logging.error(f"Permission denied to access file: {file_path}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred while processing {file_path}")
        # Re-raise if necessary, or handle gracefully
        raise # Or return False, depending on context

# Example of a global exception handler (e.g., for a Flask/FastAPI app)
def global_exception_handler(e):
    logging.exception("Unhandled exception caught by global handler")
    # Return a generic error response to the user
    return {"error": "An internal server error occurred."}

```
