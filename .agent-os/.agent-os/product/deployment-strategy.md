# Deployment Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for building, packaging, and deploying the TrojanHorse system across various environments, ensuring a consistent, automated, and reliable release process.

## Environments

- **Development:** Local developer machines. Used for active coding, unit testing, and rapid iteration.
- **Staging:** A pre-production environment that mirrors the production setup as closely as possible. Used for integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Production:** The live environment where the TrojanHorse system is used by end-users.

## Packaging

- **Method:** Docker containers will be used to package the application and its dependencies. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.
- **Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` will be created at the project root to define the build process for the application image.
- **Image Registry:** Docker images will be pushed to a private container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) after successful CI builds.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Tool:** GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD platform).
- **Triggers:** Automated builds and tests will be triggered on every push to the `main` branch and on pull requests.
- **CI Pipeline Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Retrieve the latest code from the repository.
    2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install Python dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    3.  **Run Unit Tests:** Execute all unit tests (`pytest tests/unit/`).
    4.  **Run Integration Tests:** Execute integration tests (`pytest tests/integration/`).
    5.  **Linting & Type Checking:** Run code quality checks (e.g., `flake8`, `mypy`).
    6.  **Build Docker Image:** Build the Docker image for the application.
    7.  **Tag and Push Image:** Tag the Docker image with a unique version (e.g., commit SHA, semantic version) and push it to the container registry.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

- **Tool:** GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD platform) with environment-specific workflows.
- **Triggers:**
    -   **Staging:** Manual trigger or automated trigger after successful CI build on `main` branch.
    -   **Production:** Manual trigger after successful UAT on Staging.
- **CD Pipeline Steps (per environment):**
    1.  **Pull Docker Image:** Retrieve the latest Docker image from the container registry.
    2.  **Stop Current Application:** Gracefully stop the currently running application instance.
    3.  **Start New Application:** Start a new container instance using the updated Docker image.
    4.  **Health Checks:** Perform automated health checks to ensure the new instance is running correctly.
    5.  **Rollback (if necessary):** If health checks fail, automatically roll back to the previous stable version.

## Local Deployment (for development and testing)

- **Method:** Docker Compose will be used to orchestrate local development environments, including the application and any necessary services (e.g., SQLite database).
- **docker-compose.yml:** A `docker-compose.yml` file will define the services, networks, and volumes for local development.

## Rollback Strategy

- In case of critical issues in production, the previous stable Docker image can be quickly deployed to revert to a working state.

## Security Considerations

- **Image Scanning:** Docker images will be scanned for vulnerabilities as part of the CI process.
- **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) will be managed securely using environment variables or a secrets management service, and never hardcoded into the image.
