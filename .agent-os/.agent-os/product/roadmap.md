## Phase 1: Current Development - Infrastructure Stabilization (3 weeks)

- [ ] **Environment Setup Automation** - Create production-ready config/.env generation and setup wizard
- [ ] **Testing Infrastructure Fix** - Resolve pytest configuration and run existing comprehensive test suite
- [ ] **Documentation Accuracy** - Update README and docs to reflect actual current capabilities
- [ ] **Basic Security Implementation** - Data encryption, access controls, and secure credential management
- [ ] **Error Handling Enhancement** - User-friendly error messages and automated recovery systems

## Phase 2: Advanced Features & Reliability (4 weeks)

- [ ] **Apple Podcasts API Integration:** Utilize the Apple Podcasts API to search for each podcast and pull down all the information provided in a structured way for our database. It should always prioritize the data from the podcast provided directly but supplement it with any of the structured data we have and use that to make clean and orderly content.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching, concurrent processing, and memory management
- [ ] **Full-Text Search Implementation** - Meilisearch integration for fast, typo-tolerant search
- [ ] **Advanced AI Integration** - Enhanced model selection, cost optimization, and fallback strategies  
- [ ] **Enhanced Cognitive Features** - Improved algorithms for content surfacing and knowledge graph building
- [ ] **Content Analytics** - Usage tracking, performance metrics, and recommendation algorithms

## Phase 3: Intelligence Platform Completion (4 weeks)

- [ ] **Semantic Search & Knowledge Graphs** - Vector embeddings and relationship detection
- [ ] **API Development** - Comprehensive REST API with webhook system and OAuth management
- [ ] **Third-Party Integrations** - Plugin architecture and popular tool integrations
- [ ] **Advanced User Experience** - Enhanced web interface with real-time updates and mobile responsiveness
- [ ] **Enterprise Features** - Multi-user support, role-based permissions, and scalability enhancements

## Long-Term Vision

- Continue building the world's most capable personal cognitive amplification system
- Enable sophisticated personal intelligence and insights from comprehensive data collection
- Maintain open-source, self-hosted, privacy-first philosophy
- Build ecosystem of plugins and integrations for comprehensive personal data processing
