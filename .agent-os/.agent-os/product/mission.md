# Atlas Product Mission

## Vision

Atlas aims to solve the user's dissatisfaction with existing content management solutions like Instapaper, particularly regarding subscription costs and the lack of true data ownership. The core vision is to create a self-hosted, open-source platform that allows the user to collect and manage ALL of their personal world data in a usable format.

## Problem Solved

The primary problem Atlas addresses is the difficulty in acquiring and organizing personal data in a way that facilitates future modeling and intelligence extraction. The user, a self-proclaimed "nerd who loves info and reads and thinks a lot," seeks a system that can dramatically enhance their ability to derive intelligence from their accumulated knowledge base.

## Target Users

The sole target user for Atlas is the creator themselves. It is explicitly stated that this project will never be used for commercial purposes. While the MIT license allows for broader use, the intent is for personal or single-person use only, without any commercial expectations or allowances.

## Core Value Proposition

Atlas provides a robust, self-owned solution for personal knowledge management and cognitive amplification. Its value lies in:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Complete control and ownership over personal data, free from subscriptions and third-party limitations.
- **Usable Data Acquisition**: Overcoming the challenge of making diverse personal data sources usable for analysis.
- **Future Intelligence**: Laying the groundwork for advanced personal modeling and intelligence extraction from a comprehensive data set.
- **Personal Empowerment**: Empowering the user to leverage their own information for deeper insights and understanding.
- **Apple Podcasts API Integration**: Utilize the Apple Podcasts API to search for each podcast and pull down all the information provided in a structured way for our database. It should always prioritize the data from the podcast provided directly but supplement it with any of the structured data we have and use that to make clean and orderly content.

## Non-Commercial Intent

It is crucial to reiterate that Atlas is a passion project driven by personal intellectual curiosity. There is no commercial intent, and while the MIT license permits various uses, the spirit of the project is strictly personal and non-profit.
