# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TrojanHorse project, ensuring the quality, reliability, and correctness of the system across all development phases.

## Principles

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** For new features and bug fixes, tests will be written before the code.
- **Automated Testing:** Prioritize automated tests over manual testing wherever possible.
- **Layered Testing:** Implement tests at different levels (unit, integration, end-to-end) to provide comprehensive coverage.
- **Continuous Testing:** Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on every code change.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

- **Purpose:** Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.
- **Scope:** Smallest testable units of code.
- **Framework:** `pytest`
- **Location:** `tests/unit/` directory, mirroring the source code structure.
- **Execution:** Run frequently during development and as part of pre-commit hooks.

### 2. Integration Tests

- **Purpose:** Verify that different modules or services interact correctly with each other.
- **Scope:** Interactions between components (e.g., `transcribe.py` and `search.py`, or `analyze.py` and Ollama).
- **Framework:** `pytest`
- **Location:** `tests/integration/` directory.
- **Execution:** Run as part of the CI/CD pipeline and before major releases.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Purpose:** Simulate real user scenarios to verify the entire system flow from start to finish.
- **Scope:** Full system workflows (e.g., audio capture -> transcription -> analysis -> search).
- **Framework:** `pytest` with potential use of external tools for system interaction.
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/` directory.
- **Execution:** Run less frequently, typically on staging environments or before major releases.

### 4. Performance Tests

- **Purpose:** Evaluate the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various workloads.
- **Scope:** Key functionalities like transcription speed, search query response time, and resource utilization.
- **Tools:** `locust` (for load testing), `cProfile` (for profiling Python code).
- **Execution:** Periodically or when significant architectural changes are made.

### 5. Security Tests

- **Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities and ensure the system protects data and prevents unauthorized access.
- **Scope:** PII filtering, API authentication, data encryption, and overall system hardening.
- **Tools:** Manual review, static analysis tools (SAST), dynamic analysis tools (DAST).
- **Execution:** Regularly, especially after implementing security-sensitive features.

## Test Coverage

- **Goal:** Aim for high unit test coverage (e.g., >80%) for core logic.
- **Measurement:** Use `pytest-cov` to measure and report code coverage.

## Test Execution Workflow

1.  **Local Development:** Developers run unit tests frequently.
2.  **Pre-commit Hooks:** Basic unit tests and linting run automatically before commits.
3.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** On every push to the repository, the CI pipeline will:
    -   Run all unit tests.
    -   Run integration tests.
    -   Generate test coverage reports.
    -   Run linting and type checking.
4.  **Continuous Deployment (CD):** After successful CI, E2E tests and potentially performance/security tests run on staging environments before deployment to production.

## Test Data Management

- **Principle:** Use isolated, reproducible test data for each test run.
- **Strategy:** Generate synthetic data or use anonymized subsets of real data where appropriate.

## Reporting

- Test results and coverage reports will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline's output for easy visibility.
