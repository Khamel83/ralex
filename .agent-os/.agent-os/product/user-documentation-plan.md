# User Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating and maintaining user-facing documentation for the TrojanHorse system. The goal is to provide clear, comprehensive, and accessible resources that enable users to effectively utilize all features of the application.

## Target Audience

- **End-Users:** Individuals who will be using TrojanHorse for audio capture, transcription, analysis, and search.
- **Developers/Advanced Users:** Users who might want to extend the system, integrate with it via API, or understand its internal workings.

## Documentation Types

### 1. Getting Started Guide

- **Purpose:** To help new users quickly set up and start using TrojanHorse.
- **Content:** Installation instructions, initial configuration, first-run experience, basic usage of core features (capture, transcribe).
- **Format:** Markdown, included in the main `README.md` or a dedicated `GETTING_STARTED.md`.

### 2. User Manual / Feature Guides

- **Purpose:** Detailed explanations of all features, including advanced functionalities.
- **Content:**
    - **Audio Capture:** Configuration, device selection, troubleshooting.
    - **Transcription:** Engine selection, language options, model management.
    - **Analysis (Local & Cloud):** How to use LLM analysis, PII filtering, content classification, cost optimization settings.
    - **Search & Memory:** Keyword search, semantic search, timeline analysis.
    - **Export System:** Exporting to Markdown/JSON, selecting data ranges.
    - **Multi-device Sync:** Setup, conflict resolution.
    - **Configuration:** Detailed explanation of `config.json` parameters.
- **Format:** Markdown files organized by feature, potentially compiled into a static site.

### 3. Troubleshooting Guide

- **Purpose:** To help users diagnose and resolve common issues.
- **Content:** FAQs, common error messages and their solutions, steps for gathering diagnostic information.
- **Format:** Markdown, linked from other documentation.

### 4. API Reference (for Developers/Advanced Users)

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation for the TrojanHorse API, enabling external integrations.
- **Content:** Endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, authentication methods, error codes, examples.
- **Format:** OpenAPI/Swagger specification, rendered as interactive documentation.

## Documentation Tools

- **Markdown:** For all text-based documentation, ensuring easy readability and version control.
- **MkDocs (or Sphinx):** For compiling Markdown files into a navigable static website, providing a better user experience than raw Markdown files.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger UI:** For interactive API documentation.

## Documentation Location

- All user documentation source files will reside in the `docs/` directory within the `TrojanHorse` project.
- The compiled static site will be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages, Read the Docs).

## Maintenance & Update Process

- **Version Control:** Documentation will be version-controlled alongside the code in the Git repository.
- **Feature-Driven Documentation:** New features will require corresponding updates to the user documentation as part of their development process.
- **Regular Review:** Documentation will be reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly) to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide a way for users to submit feedback or suggest improvements to the documentation.

## Initial Steps

1.  Create a `docs/` directory within the `TrojanHorse` project (if not already present).
2.  Populate `docs/` with initial `GETTING_STARTED.md` and `USER_MANUAL.md` (or similar structure).
3.  Set up MkDocs (or Sphinx) for local documentation generation.
