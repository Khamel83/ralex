# Observability Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for monitoring, logging, and alerting within the TrojanHorse system. The goal is to ensure visibility into the system's health, performance, and behavior, enabling proactive issue detection and efficient troubleshooting.

## Pillars of Observability

### 1. Logging

- **Purpose:** To record events, errors, and operational data for debugging, auditing, and post-mortem analysis.
- **Approach:**
    - **Structured Logging:** All logs will be generated in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate easy parsing and analysis.
    - **Log Levels:** Standard logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be used consistently.
    - **Contextual Information:** Logs will include relevant contextual information such as timestamp, module, function name, process ID, and unique request IDs (where applicable).
    - **Centralized Logging:** Logs will be collected from all components and forwarded to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki) for aggregation, search, and analysis.
- **Implementation:** Python's built-in `logging` module will be configured to output structured logs.

### 2. Metrics

- **Purpose:** To quantify the system's behavior and performance over time, enabling trend analysis, capacity planning, and performance issue detection.
- **Approach:**
    - **Key Metrics:** Collect metrics for:
        - **System Health:** CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O.
        - **Application Performance:** Transcription duration, search query response times, API latency.
        - **Resource Utilization:** Ollama model load, database connection pool usage.
        - **Error Rates:** Number of errors per module/service.
    - **Metric Types:** Use appropriate metric types (counters, gauges, histograms, summaries).
    - **Collection:** Metrics will be exposed via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint or pushed to a metrics store.
- **Tools:** Prometheus for time-series data collection and storage.

### 3. Tracing (Future Consideration)

- **Purpose:** To track the flow of requests or operations across different components of the system, providing end-to-end visibility for complex interactions.
- **Approach:** Distributed tracing will be considered for future phases as the system grows in complexity.
- **Tools:** OpenTelemetry (or similar standard) for instrumentation, Jaeger/Zipkin for visualization.

## Alerting

- **Purpose:** To notify relevant stakeholders immediately when predefined thresholds are breached or critical events occur.
- **Approach:**
    - **Alert Rules:** Define clear alert rules based on critical metrics and log patterns.
    - **Severity Levels:** Categorize alerts by severity (e.g., Critical, Warning, Info).
    - **Notification Channels:** Configure notifications via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.
    - **Runbooks:** Provide clear runbooks or remediation steps for each alert.
- **Tools:** Alertmanager (integrated with Prometheus) for alert routing and deduplication.

## Dashboards & Visualization

- **Purpose:** To provide real-time and historical views of system health and performance.
- **Tools:** Grafana for creating interactive dashboards, visualizing metrics, and exploring logs.

## Implementation Details

- **Configuration:** Logging and metrics configuration will be managed via `config.json` or environment variables.
- **Instrumentation:** Key modules and functions will be instrumented to emit relevant logs and metrics.
- **Review:** Regular reviews of logs, metrics, and alerts will be conducted to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
