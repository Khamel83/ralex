# Agent OS Integration - K83 Framework

> Last Updated: 2025-08-07
> Version: 1.0.0
> Framework: K83 Universal MCP + Agentic Workflows

## Overview

The K83 framework integrates Agent OS methodology with universal MCP integration and agentic coding workflows. This Agent OS configuration enables structured AI-assisted development with context preservation across Claude Code sessions and model switches.

## K83 Framework Architecture

K83 combines:
- **Agent OS Foundation** - Spec-driven development methodology
- **Universal MCP Integration** - 6 essential MCP servers for comprehensive tooling
- **Agentic Workflows** - Autonomous coding with `/yolo` and orchestration commands
- **Context Management** - Persistent memory across sessions and model switches
- **Claude Code Integration** - Everything accessible via slash commands

## Agent OS Commands for K83

### Core Workflow Commands
- `/yolo "build feature X"` - Autonomous coding until completion using Agent OS methodology
- `/orchestrate "complex task"` - Full Agent OS workflow (spec → implement → test → fix)
- `/spec "requirements"` - Create detailed Agent OS specification
- `/execute-tasks` - Implement current spec with Agent OS patterns

### Context & Memory Commands  
- `/save-session "milestone note"` - Save context + git commit with Agent OS conventions
- `/switch-model gpt-4` - Change models preserving Agent OS context
- `/memory-save "spec decision"` - Store in persistent Agent OS memory
- `/memory-recall "query"` - Retrieve from Agent OS knowledge base

## K83-Specific Agent OS Integration

### Agentic Development Patterns
- Specs automatically include MCP server requirements and integrations
- Tasks are broken down for autonomous execution via `/yolo` workflows
- Context preservation patterns ensure continuity across model switches

### MCP Server Integration
- All specs consider the 6 essential MCP servers (GitHub, FileSystem, Memory, Sequential Thinking, Database, Web)
- Technical specifications include MCP orchestration patterns
- Implementation tasks leverage MCP capabilities for enhanced development

### Context-Aware Workflows
- Agent OS methodology adapted for persistent memory across sessions
- Spec decisions stored in memory for consistent development patterns
- Model switching preserves full Agent OS context and state

## Usage Patterns

### Start New Feature (Agent OS + K83)
```
/spec "user authentication with JWT and role-based permissions"
# Creates full Agent OS spec with MCP server integration points
# Automatically considers GitHub, Database, and Memory MCP servers
```

### Autonomous Implementation
```
/yolo "implement the user auth spec with full test coverage"
# Uses Agent OS methodology: spec review → implementation → testing → fixing
# Leverages all relevant MCP servers automatically
# Preserves context for session continuity
```

### Context-Aware Development
```
/save-session "user auth MVP completed"
/switch-model "gpt-4-turbo"  
/yolo "add OAuth integration to existing auth system"
# Full Agent OS context preserved across model switch
# New model has complete spec history and implementation context
```

## Integration with K83 Core Systems

- **StateManager**: Agent OS specs and decisions stored in persistent memory
- **Context Preservation**: All Agent OS workflows maintain state across sessions
- **MCP Orchestration**: Agent OS patterns leverage all 6 MCP servers seamlessly
- **Autonomous Workflows**: `/yolo` follows Agent OS methodology for structured development

## Getting Started

1. Use Agent OS slash commands directly in Claude Code
2. All workflows automatically follow Agent OS methodology
3. Context and specs persist across sessions and model switches
4. MCP servers are automatically leveraged based on Agent OS patterns

The K83 framework makes Agent OS methodology instantly accessible via slash commands while maintaining the full power of structured, spec-driven development with universal MCP integration.
