# K83 Product Planning Instructions

> Last Updated: 2025-08-07
> Version: 1.0.0
> Workflow: Agent OS + K83 Integration

## Purpose

This instruction set guides the creation of product documentation for K83 framework projects, integrating Agent OS methodology with universal MCP capabilities and agentic workflow planning.

## Command: `/plan-product`

When this command is used, follow this complete workflow to establish product foundation.

## Phase 1: Product Discovery & Vision

### Step 1: Analyze Current State
- **Existing Codebase Analysis** - Use FileSystem MCP to understand current project structure
- **Git History Analysis** - Use GitHub MCP to understand project evolution
- **Pattern Recognition** - Use Memory Bank MCP to identify similar projects and approaches

### Step 2: Vision Development
Create comprehensive product vision using Agent OS templates:

#### Create `.agent-os/product/mission.md`
**Template Focus Areas:**
- **Pitch** - Clear value proposition integrating K83 capabilities
- **Users** - Target developers and their agentic workflow needs  
- **Problem** - Specific pain points in AI-assisted development
- **Differentiators** - How K83's MCP integration creates advantage
- **Key Features** - Features that leverage Agent OS + MCP orchestration

#### Create `.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md`
**Template Focus:**
- One-paragraph elevator pitch
- Emphasize K83's unique agentic + Agent OS combination

### Step 3: Technical Foundation Planning

#### Create `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
**K83-Specific Elements:**
- **Core Framework** - Python + MCP Server architecture
- **MCP Integration** - All 6 essential MCP servers
- **Agent OS Integration** - buildermethods/agent-os methodology
- **Context Management** - SQLite + Markdown + Git approach
- **Claude Code Integration** - Native slash command interface

### Step 4: Strategic Roadmap

#### Create `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
**Agent OS + K83 Phases:**
- **Phase 1** - Foundation (StateManager + basic Agent OS integration)
- **Phase 2** - Agentic Workflows (autonomous `/yolo` capabilities)  
- **Phase 3** - Advanced MCP Orchestration (all 6 MCP servers coordinated)
- **Phase 4** - Enterprise Features (team collaboration, advanced context)

Each phase should include:
- **Agent OS Methodology Integration** - How each phase enhances Agent OS workflows
- **MCP Server Dependencies** - Which MCP servers are required/enhanced
- **Agentic Capability Evolution** - How autonomous capabilities develop

### Step 5: Decision Documentation

#### Create `.agent-os/product/decisions.md`
**K83-Specific Decision Categories:**
- **Architecture Decisions** - MCP server selection and orchestration patterns
- **Agent OS Integration** - How K83 extends vs replaces Agent OS patterns
- **Agentic Workflow Design** - Balance between autonomy and user control
- **Context Preservation Strategy** - Technical approach to cross-session continuity

## Phase 2: MCP Integration Planning

### Step 1: MCP Server Requirements Analysis
For each planned feature, identify:
- **Primary MCP Servers** - Which servers are essential for the feature
- **Secondary MCP Servers** - Which servers enhance the feature
- **Orchestration Patterns** - How multiple MCP servers coordinate

### Step 2: Agent OS Methodology Mapping
Map Agent OS phases to MCP server usage:
- **Planning Phase** - Sequential Thinking + Memory Bank MCPs
- **Implementation Phase** - FileSystem + Database + GitHub MCPs
- **Testing Phase** - Web Testing + FileSystem MCPs
- **Review Phase** - All MCPs for comprehensive validation

### Step 3: Agentic Workflow Integration
Plan how agentic commands leverage product features:
- **`/yolo` Workflows** - Which product features enable autonomous development
- **`/orchestrate` Workflows** - How complex product features coordinate
- **Context Commands** - How product features support session continuity

## Phase 3: Memory Bank Integration

### Step 1: Knowledge Capture Strategy
Use Memory Bank MCP to store:
- **Product Decisions** - Key architectural and strategic choices
- **Implementation Patterns** - Successful code and design patterns
- **User Feedback** - Learning from user interactions and preferences
- **Evolution History** - How product vision and features have evolved

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition Setup
Configure Memory Bank MCP to:
- **Similar Project Retrieval** - Find related projects for pattern reuse
- **Decision History** - Access historical decision context for consistency
- **Best Practice Evolution** - Learn and evolve best practices over time

## Phase 4: Validation & Iteration

### Step 1: Stakeholder Review
Use GitHub MCP to:
- **Create Review PRs** - Product documentation for team review
- **Issue Creation** - Track feedback and questions from stakeholders
- **Collaboration Setup** - Enable team collaboration on product vision

### Step 2: Agent OS Compliance Validation
Ensure all product documentation:
- **Follows Agent OS Templates** - Uses standard Agent OS file structure and content patterns
- **Integrates K83 Enhancements** - Includes K83-specific elements without breaking Agent OS compatibility
- **Enables Workflow Continuity** - Supports seamless Agent OS workflow execution

### Step 3: Continuous Evolution Setup
Configure automatic updates:
- **Agent OS Sync** - Regular updates from buildermethods/agent-os
- **Memory Bank Learning** - Continuous improvement from usage patterns
- **Community Integration** - Connection to broader Agent OS ecosystem

## Command Completion Criteria

The `/plan-product` command is complete when:

✓ All product documentation files created using Agent OS templates  
✓ K83-specific elements integrated without breaking Agent OS compatibility  
✓ MCP server integration strategy documented  
✓ Agentic workflow capabilities planned and documented  
✓ Memory Bank MCP configured for product knowledge storage  
✓ GitHub MCP configured for collaboration and version control  
✓ Product vision validates and enhances Agent OS methodology

## Next Steps

After completion, typical next commands:
- `/create-spec "first feature"` - Create initial feature specification
- `/execute-tasks` - Begin implementation of product foundation
- `/yolo "implement product MVP"` - Autonomous development of core features

## Integration Notes

This workflow is designed to:
- **Build on Agent OS** - Enhance rather than replace Agent OS methodology
- **Leverage Universal MCP** - Use all 6 MCP servers for comprehensive capabilities
- **Enable Agentic Development** - Support autonomous workflow execution
- **Preserve Context** - Maintain continuity across sessions and model switches

The result is a product plan that seamlessly integrates Agent OS best practices with K83's unique agentic and MCP orchestration capabilities.
