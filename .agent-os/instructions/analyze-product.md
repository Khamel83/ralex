> Workflow: Agent OS + K83 Integration Analysis

## Purpose

This instruction set guides the analysis of existing codebases to add Agent OS + K83 integration, enabling agentic workflows and MCP orchestration for established projects.

## Command: `/analyze-product`

When this command is used, follow this complete workflow to analyze existing code and integrate K83 framework capabilities.

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

### Step 1: Initial Discovery & Scanning
Use FileSystem MCP for systematic codebase analysis:

def analyze_existing_codebase():
    # Scan directory structure
    structure = filesystem_mcp.analyze_directory_structure(project_root)
    
    # Identify tech stack and frameworks
    tech_stack = filesystem_mcp.identify_technologies(project_root)
    
    # Analyze existing documentation
    documentation = filesystem_mcp.find_and_analyze_docs(project_root)
    
    # Check for existing Agent OS integration
    agent_os_status = filesystem_mcp.check_agent_os_integration(project_root)
    
    return ProjectAnalysis(structure, tech_stack, documentation, agent_os_status)
