# K83 Feature Specification Instructions

> Last Updated: 2025-08-07
> Version: 1.0.0
> Workflow: Agent OS + K83 Agentic Integration

## Purpose

This instruction set guides the creation of feature specifications for K83 framework projects, integrating Agent OS methodology with MCP-aware planning and agentic workflow preparation.

## Command: `/spec "feature requirements"`

When this command is used, follow this complete workflow to create comprehensive feature specifications.

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Context

### Step 1: Context-Aware Analysis
- **Memory Bank Query** - Use Memory Bank MCP to find similar features and decisions
- **Project State Analysis** - Use FileSystem MCP to understand current codebase
- **Git History Context** - Use GitHub MCP to understand recent changes and direction
- **Sequential Reasoning** - Use Sequential Thinking MCP for systematic requirement analysis

### Step 2: Agent OS Spec Structure Creation
Create spec directory following Agent OS patterns:

```
.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/
├── spec.md                 # Main specification (Agent OS template)
├── spec-lite.md           # Summary version
├── tasks.md               # Implementation tasks with MCP integration
└── sub-specs/
    ├── technical-spec.md  # Technical details with MCP orchestration
    ├── database-schema.md # Database changes (Database MCP integration)
    ├── api-spec.md        # API design (Web Testing MCP integration)
    └── tests.md           # Testing strategy (Web Testing MCP integration)
```

## Phase 2: Core Specification Development

### Step 1: Create Main Specification (spec.md)

#### Agent OS Template Integration
**Use standard Agent OS spec.md template with K83 enhancements:**

```markdown

## Phase 4: Implementation Planning

### Step 1: Task Breakdown (tasks.md)
**Agent OS task template with agentic workflow preparation:**

```markdown
# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/[FOLDER]/spec.md

> Created: [CURRENT_DATE]
> Status: Ready for Implementation
> Agentic Readiness: [Ready/Partial/Manual]

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] **Task 1:** [Description with MCP server requirements]
  - **MCP Integration:** [Which servers, how they coordinate]
  - **Autonomous Readiness:** [Can `/yolo` handle this? Requirements?]
  - **Dependencies:** [Other tasks or external requirements]

[Continue for all tasks]

## Agentic Workflow Readiness

[List tasks that can be handled autonomously]

### `/orchestrate` Required Tasks
[List complex tasks needing orchestrated approach]

### Manual Intervention Tasks
[List tasks requiring human oversight]

## MCP Server Coordination Plan
[How different MCPs will work together across all tasks]
```

## Phase 5: Memory Bank Integration

### Step 1: Knowledge Storage Strategy
Use Memory Bank MCP to store:
- **Spec Decisions** - Key architectural and design choices
- **Similar Feature Patterns** - Related implementations for pattern reuse
- **Implementation Learnings** - Lessons from similar features
- **User Preferences** - Style and approach preferences for this type of feature

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition Setup
Configure Memory Bank MCP queries for:
- **Similar Specifications** - Find related specs for consistency
- **Implementation Patterns** - Successful code patterns for this feature type
- **Test Strategies** - Proven testing approaches for similar features

## Phase 6: Agentic Workflow Preparation

### Step 1: Autonomous Development Assessment
For each task, determine:
- **Automation Level** - Fully autonomous, guided, or manual
- **MCP Dependencies** - Which servers are required for autonomous execution
- **Error Recovery** - How autonomous workflows handle failures
- **Quality Gates** - Automated quality checks and validations

### Step 2: Context Continuity Planning
Plan how this feature supports:
- **Session Persistence** - What state needs to survive session breaks
- **Model Switching** - How feature development continues across model changes
- **Workflow Resumption** - Checkpoints for resuming interrupted development

## Phase 7: Validation & Integration

### Step 1: Agent OS Compliance Check
Ensure specification:
- **Follows Agent OS Templates** - Standard file structure and content patterns
- **Maintains Agent OS Compatibility** - Can be used with standard Agent OS workflows
- **Enhances Agent OS Capabilities** - Adds K83 benefits without breaking existing patterns

### Step 2: MCP Integration Validation
Verify:
- **MCP Server Availability** - All required servers are available and configured
- **Orchestration Feasibility** - Multiple MCP coordination is practical
- **Performance Considerations** - MCP coordination won't create bottlenecks

### Step 3: Agentic Readiness Assessment
Confirm:
- **Autonomous Viability** - Feature can be developed with appropriate autonomy level
- **Context Preservation** - Feature supports session continuity requirements
- **Quality Assurance** - Automated quality checks are sufficient

## Command Completion Criteria

The `/spec` command is complete when:

✓ Complete Agent OS spec structure created with K83 enhancements  
✓ MCP server integration strategy documented for all required servers  
✓ Agentic workflow readiness assessed and documented  
✓ Context preservation requirements identified and planned  
✓ Memory Bank MCP configured for spec knowledge storage  
✓ All sub-specifications created with appropriate MCP integration  
✓ Tasks broken down with autonomous development assessment  
✓ Agent OS compatibility maintained while adding K83 capabilities

## Next Steps

After completion, typical next commands:
- `/execute-tasks` - Begin systematic implementation following the specification
- `/yolo "implement [feature-name]"` - Autonomous implementation if spec supports it
- `/orchestrate "[complex-feature-name]"` - Orchestrated implementation for complex features

## Integration Notes

This workflow is designed to:
- **Extend Agent OS** - Add K83 capabilities while maintaining Agent OS methodology
- **Enable MCP Orchestration** - Prepare specifications for multi-MCP coordination
- **Support Agentic Development** - Create specs that autonomous workflows can execute
- **Preserve Context** - Plan for session continuity and model switching

The result is a comprehensive specification that seamlessly integrates Agent OS best practices with K83's unique agentic and MCP orchestration capabilities, enabling both traditional and autonomous development workflows.
