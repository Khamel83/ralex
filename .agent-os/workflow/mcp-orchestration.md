## Orchestration Patterns

### Agent OS Methodology + MCP Integration

#### Spec Creation Workflow
```
User Request → Sequential Thinking MCP (analysis) → Memory Bank MCP (pattern lookup) → 
FileSystem MCP (spec creation) → GitHub MCP (version control)
```

**MCP Coordination:**
1. **Sequential Thinking MCP** - Breaks down requirements systematically
2. **Memory Bank MCP** - Retrieves similar specs and decisions from history
3. **FileSystem MCP** - Creates Agent OS spec files in proper structure
4. **GitHub MCP** - Commits spec to version control with proper tagging

#### Implementation Workflow  
```
Agent OS Spec → FileSystem MCP (code generation) → Database MCP (schema) → 
Web Testing MCP (testing) → GitHub MCP (integration)
```

**MCP Coordination:**
1. **FileSystem MCP** - Creates code files following Agent OS patterns
2. **Database MCP** - Handles any required schema changes or migrations
3. **Web Testing MCP** - Generates and runs tests based on specifications
4. **Memory Bank MCP** - Stores implementation patterns and decisions
5. **GitHub MCP** - Manages git workflow and collaboration

### Agentic Workflow Orchestration

#### `/yolo` Command MCP Flow
```
Feature Request → Sequential Thinking MCP (planning) → Multi-MCP Execution → 
Web Testing MCP (validation) → Memory Bank MCP (learning) → GitHub MCP (delivery)
```

**Autonomous Coordination:**
- **Planning Phase** - Sequential Thinking MCP creates execution plan
- **Implementation Phase** - FileSystem + Database MCPs handle code generation
- **Testing Phase** - Web Testing MCP validates functionality
- **Learning Phase** - Memory Bank MCP stores successful patterns
- **Delivery Phase** - GitHub MCP handles git operations and deployment

#### `/orchestrate` Command MCP Flow
```
Complex Task → Sequential Thinking MCP (decomposition) → Parallel MCP Execution →
Cross-MCP Validation → Memory Bank MCP (pattern storage) → GitHub MCP (coordination)
```

**Complex System Coordination:**
- **Task Decomposition** - Sequential Thinking MCP breaks complex tasks
- **Parallel Execution** - Multiple MCPs work simultaneously on subtasks
- **Cross-Validation** - MCPs validate each other's outputs
- **Integration** - FileSystem MCP coordinates file and system integration
- **Quality Assurance** - Web Testing MCP provides comprehensive testing

## MCP Server Communication Patterns

### Direct MCP Calls
For simple, single-purpose operations:
```python
# Example: Simple file creation
filesystem_mcp.create_file(path, content)
github_mcp.commit_changes("Add new feature spec")
```

### Coordinated MCP Workflows
For complex operations requiring multiple MCPs:
```python
# Example: Complete feature implementation
sequential_thinking.plan_implementation(spec)
patterns = memory_bank.retrieve_similar_patterns(spec.requirements)
code = filesystem.generate_code(spec, patterns)
schema = database.create_migrations(spec.data_requirements)
tests = web_testing.generate_tests(spec.endpoints)
github.commit_all_changes("Implement feature: " + spec.name)
memory_bank.store_implementation_pattern(spec, code, "successful")
```

### Error Handling Across MCPs
```python
try:
    # Coordinated MCP operation
    result = orchestrate_mcps(operation)
except MCPError as e:
    # Rollback across all affected MCPs
    rollback_handler.revert_mcp_changes(operation.affected_mcps)
    # Store failure pattern for learning
    memory_bank.store_failure_pattern(operation, e)
    # Attempt alternative approach
    alternative = sequential_thinking.generate_alternative(operation, e)
    return orchestrate_mcps(alternative)
```

## Context-Aware MCP Selection

### Task-Based MCP Routing
Different task types automatically engage appropriate MCP combinations:

**Code Generation Tasks:**
- Primary: FileSystem MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP
- Secondary: Memory Bank MCP (patterns), GitHub MCP (versioning)

**Database Tasks:**
- Primary: Database MCP, FileSystem MCP
- Secondary: Sequential Thinking MCP (planning), GitHub MCP (versioning)

**Testing Tasks:**
- Primary: Web Testing MCP, FileSystem MCP  
- Secondary: Database MCP (test data), Memory Bank MCP (test patterns)

### Capability-Based Selection
MCPs selected based on their specific capabilities for the task:

**Complex Reasoning:** Sequential Thinking MCP + Memory Bank MCP
**File Operations:** FileSystem MCP + GitHub MCP
**Data Operations:** Database MCP + FileSystem MCP
**Validation:** Web Testing MCP + Sequential Thinking MCP

## Agent OS Integration Points

### Spec-Driven MCP Coordination
Agent OS specifications automatically determine MCP orchestration:

**User Stories → Web Testing MCP** (test case generation)
**Technical Requirements → Database MCP** (schema planning)
**Implementation Tasks → FileSystem MCP** (code structure)
**Quality Gates → Memory Bank MCP** (pattern validation)

### Agent OS Phase Mapping
Each Agent OS methodology phase maps to specific MCP combinations:

**Planning Phase:**
- Sequential Thinking MCP for systematic analysis
- Memory Bank MCP for historical pattern retrieval
- FileSystem MCP for spec document creation

**Implementation Phase:**
- FileSystem MCP for code generation
- Database MCP for schema management
- GitHub MCP for version control workflow

**Testing Phase:**
- Web Testing MCP for automated testing
- Sequential Thinking MCP for test strategy
- Memory Bank MCP for test pattern storage

**Review Phase:**
- All MCPs for comprehensive system validation
- Memory Bank MCP for lessons learned storage
- GitHub MCP for final integration

## Performance & Reliability

### MCP Health Monitoring
- **Connection Status** - Monitor all MCP server connections
- **Response Times** - Track performance across MCP operations
- **Error Rates** - Monitor and alert on MCP failures
- **Resource Usage** - Ensure MCP servers don't overwhelm system

### Fault Tolerance
- **MCP Fallbacks** - Alternative approaches when MCPs unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation** - Reduced functionality vs complete failure
- **Auto-Recovery** - Automatic MCP reconnection and retry logic
- **State Consistency** - Ensure consistency across MCP operations

### Load Balancing
- **Operation Queuing** - Manage concurrent MCP operations
- **Priority Handling** - Critical operations get priority access
- **Resource Allocation** - Balance load across available MCP servers
- **Capacity Planning** - Monitor and scale MCP resources

## Extensibility & Customization

### Custom MCP Integration
Framework for adding new MCP servers to K83:

```yaml
# mcp-config.yaml
custom_mcps:
  design_mcp:
    purpose: "UI/UX design automation"
    integration_points: ["spec_creation", "implementation"]
    agent_os_phases: ["planning", "implementation"]
    
  security_mcp:
    purpose: "Security analysis and hardening"  
    integration_points: ["implementation", "testing", "review"]
    agent_os_phases: ["implementation", "review"]
```

### Project-Specific MCP Configuration
- **MCP Selection** - Choose which MCPs are active for specific projects
- **Workflow Customization** - Modify MCP orchestration for project needs
- **Integration Patterns** - Custom patterns for specific tech stacks
- **Performance Tuning** - Optimize MCP usage for project characteristics

The K83 MCP orchestration system creates a unified, intelligent development environment that leverages the best tools available while maintaining the structured approach of Agent OS methodology.
