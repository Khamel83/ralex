## Key Historical Context

### Version Evolution
- **V1**: Terminal-only AI coding assistant
- **V2**: Added semantic routing and cost optimization
- **V3**: Added voice interface and web UI (partially implemented)
- **V4**: Full orchestration architecture with OpenCode + LiteLLM + AgentOS

### Preserved Learnings
1. **V3 roadmap insights** - Voice interface requirements and Open WebUI integration
2. **Integration patterns** - How different AI providers were tested and integrated
3. **Testing approaches** - Various testing strategies attempted
4. **UI/UX experiments** - Different approaches to voice and web interfaces

## Reference Usage

These files are kept for:
- **Historical reference** when making architectural decisions
- **Code patterns** that might be useful in V4
- **Integration examples** showing what worked and what didn't
- **Testing strategies** to avoid repeating mistakes

## Archive Date
