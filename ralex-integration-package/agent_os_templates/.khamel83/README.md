# Khamel83 Agent-OS Enhancements

This layer adds cost optimization and Ralex-specific enhancements to Agent-OS.

## Cost Optimization Strategy
- Use expensive models for planning/architecture
- Route implementation to cheap models via LiteLLM
- Cache solutions and patterns for reuse
- Break complex tasks into micro-tasks

## Components
- `cost-optimization/` - Cost-saving strategies and templates
- `model-routing/` - LiteLLM routing configurations
- `ralex-enhancements/` - Ralex-specific integrations
- `cache/` - Cached solutions and patterns

## Integration
Works with standard Agent-OS while adding intelligence for cost optimization.

## Goal
Achieve $50 worth of AI results for $1 using intelligent task decomposition and model routing.
