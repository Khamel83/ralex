- [ ] **Technology stack** documented with versions
- [ ] **Development processes** documented
- [ ] **Deployment procedures** documented

**If documentation is missing:**
Create basic structure using templates in this workflow.

## Step 3: Pattern and Workflow Setup

### Pattern Library Initialization
```bash
# Create pattern library structure
mkdir -p .project/patterns/{successful-approaches,reusable-solutions,common-tasks}

# Initialize tracking files
touch .project/development-log.json
touch .project/pattern-library.md
touch .project/workflow-preferences.md
```

### Development Workflow Setup
**Template: `.project/development-log.json`**
```json
{
  "project": "[PROJECT_NAME]",
  "start_date": "[DATE]",
  "workflow_preferences": {
    "task_breakdown_approach": "systematic",
    "documentation_level": "comprehensive",
    "testing_approach": "test-driven",
    "review_process": "peer-review"
  },
  "patterns_used": [],
  "lessons_learned": []
}
```

### Development Environment Configuration
- [ ] **Code formatting** configured and consistent
- [ ] **Testing framework** set up and working
- [ ] **Build/deployment scripts** verified
- [ ] **Development tools** configured for team consistency

## Step 4: Project Context Documentation

### Current State Assessment
**Create: `docs/project-current-state.md`**

```markdown
# Project Current State - [PROJECT_NAME]

## Technical Assessment
**Date**: [DATE]
**Assessor**: [YOUR_NAME]

### Codebase Health
- **Lines of Code**: [COUNT]
- **Test Coverage**: [PERCENTAGE]%
- **Technical Debt Score**: [SCORE]/10
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: [COUNT]

### Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: [FRAMEWORK_VERSION]
- **Database**: [DATABASE_TYPE]
- **Deployment**: [PLATFORM]
- **Key Dependencies**: [LIST]

### Feature Completeness
- **Core Features**: [PERCENTAGE]% complete
- **User Features**: [PERCENTAGE]% complete
- **Admin Features**: [PERCENTAGE]% complete
- **API Coverage**: [PERCENTAGE]% complete

### Development Workflow
- **Build Time**: [MINUTES] minutes
- **Test Suite Time**: [MINUTES] minutes
- **Deployment Time**: [MINUTES] minutes
- **Local Development**: ✅/❌ Working

### Outstanding Work
- **Critical Issues**: [COUNT]
- **Feature Requests**: [COUNT]
- **Technical Debt Items**: [COUNT]
- **Security Issues**: [COUNT]
```

## Step 5: Development Environment Verification

### Local Environment Check
- [ ] **Development server** starts successfully
- [ ] **Database** connects and migrates
- [ ] **Tests** run and pass
- [ ] **Build process** completes without errors
- [ ] **Linting/formatting** tools configured

### Development Tools Integration
- [ ] **IDE/Editor** configured with project standards
- [ ] **Git hooks** installed and working
- [ ] **Pre-commit checks** enabled
- [ ] **Code formatting** automated

## Step 6: Team & Communication Setup

### Stakeholder Identification
- **Product Owner**: [NAME] - [CONTACT]
- **Technical Lead**: [NAME] - [CONTACT]  
- **Previous Developer**: [NAME] - [CONTACT]
- **QA/Testing**: [NAME] - [CONTACT]
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: [NAME] - [CONTACT]

### Communication Channels
- **Primary**: [SLACK/DISCORD/EMAIL]
- **Code Reviews**: [GITHUB/GITLAB]
- **Project Management**: [JIRA/ASANA/TRELLO]
- **Documentation**: [CONFLUENCE/NOTION/WIKI]

## Step 7: First Task Identification

### Quick Wins Identification
Look for tasks that are:
- [ ] **Low complexity** but **high impact**
- [ ] **Well-defined** with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Independent** of other complex work
- [ ] **Demonstrable** to stakeholders

### Pattern Matching Opportunities
- [ ] **Similar features** to existing code
- [ ] **CRUD operations** that can be templated
- [ ] **API endpoints** following existing patterns
- [ ] **UI components** similar to existing ones

### Systematic Development Opportunities
Identify tasks suitable for:
- [ ] **Structured breakdown** (planning/implementation/review phases)
- [ ] **Task decomposition** (breaking complex work into manageable pieces)
- [ ] **Pattern reuse** (leveraging successful approaches from similar work)
- [ ] **Batch processing** (grouping similar tasks for efficiency)

## Step 8: Success Metrics & Goals

### Project Success Criteria
- **Quality Standards**: Test coverage >[PERCENTAGE]%, bug rate <[PERCENTAGE]%
- **Delivery Timeline**: [TIMELINE] for [SCOPE]
- **Process Improvement**: Document [COUNT] reusable patterns/approaches
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive handover documentation

### First Sprint Planning
**Duration**: [WEEKS] weeks
**Goals**:
1. [GOAL_1]
2. [GOAL_2]
3. [GOAL_3]

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] [METRIC_1]: [TARGET]
- [ ] [METRIC_2]: [TARGET]
- [ ] [METRIC_3]: [TARGET]
