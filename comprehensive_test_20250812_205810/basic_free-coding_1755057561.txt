I've created a simple HTML form with validation named `contact-form.html` in the root directory. The form includes:

1. Fields for name, email, phone, subject, and message
2. Client-side validation with real-time feedback
3. Visual styling for error and success states
4. Responsive design
5. Success message on submission

Features:
- Required fields are marked with asterisks
- Real-time validation as users type or leave fields
- Email format validation
- Phone number validation (optional field)
- Minimum character count for message field
- Visual indicators for valid/invalid fields
- Success message on successful submission

The form uses JavaScript for validation and provides clear error messages when fields don't meet requirements. You can open the file in any web browser to use the form.
