I've created a Python file with two implementations of the factorial function:

1. `factorial(n)` - An iterative implementation that's more memory efficient
2. `factorial_recursive(n)` - A recursive implementation that demonstrates the mathematical definition

Both functions include proper error handling for negative numbers and non-integer inputs. The file also includes test code that demonstrates how to use both functions with sample values.

To run the code, you can execute:
```bash
python /home/ubuntu/dev/RalexOS/factorial.py
```
