I need to read the file first before writing to it. I will read the file and then write the factorial function to it.

It seems the `factorial.py` file already contains a factorial function, including both iterative and recursive implementations, along with error handling and test cases.

If you want to add a *new* factorial function, please provide a different name for it. If you want to *modify* the existing `factorial` function, please specify the changes you'd like to make.

For now, I will assume you want to add a new function called `simple_factorial` that is a basic recursive implementation without the extensive error handling or iterative version already present.[92m[1m| [0m[90m Write    [0mfactorial.py

I have added a `simple_factorial` function to `factorial.py`.
