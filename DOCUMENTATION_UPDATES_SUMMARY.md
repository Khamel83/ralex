    - Multi-file detection (+2 complexity points)
    - Testing requirements recognition (+1 point)
    - Refactoring mentions (+3 points) 
    - Architecture/design keywords (+3 points)
    - Performance optimization needs (+2 points)
    - Question type classification (explanation/implementation/debugging/review)
```

#### **4. Context-Aware Standards Selection**
```python
def get_relevant_standards(suggested_standards):
    - File-type based suggestions (Python ‚Üí python standards)
    - Complexity-based additions (complex ‚Üí testing + error-handling)
    - Enhancement factor integration (architecture ‚Üí design-patterns)
    - Dynamic standard loading based on session context
```

#### **5. Enhanced Prompt Generation**
```python
def enhance_web_request_v2(user_message, session_id):
    - Comprehensive context building with file analysis
    - Relevant standards selection (not all standards every time)
    - Session-aware file content inclusion with analysis metadata
    - Context-aware response instructions based on complexity
    - Enhanced reasoning generation for model selection
```

## üîß **AgentOS Technical Improvements**

### **Enhanced Capabilities**

1. **AST-Based Code Analysis**
   - Python: Function/class extraction, import analysis, complexity scoring
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: Regex-based pattern matching for functions/classes
   - Language detection for 15+ programming languages
   - Code pattern extraction for context suggestions

2. **Advanced File Reference Detection**
   ```python
   # Enhanced patterns for:
   - Explicit file references: `file.py`, "path/file.js", 'module.py'
   - Function references: `function()`, method names in backticks
   - Class references: Class.method patterns, class definitions
   - Module references: import statements, require() calls
   ```

3. **Multi-Factor Complexity Analysis**
   ```python
   # New complexity factors:
   - Multiple files mentioned (+2 points)
   - Testing requirements (+1 point)  
   - Refactoring needs (+3 points)
   - Architecture decisions (+3 points)
   - Performance optimization (+2 points)
   - Question type classification (explanation/implementation/etc)
   ```

4. **Context-Aware Standards Application**
   - Dynamic standard selection based on file types in context
   - Complexity-based standard additions (testing, error-handling)
   - Session-aware standard recommendations
   - Relevant standards only (not overwhelming prompts)

### **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Caching Layer** - Context cache for repeated requests
2. **Pattern Memory** - Session-level pattern recognition
3. **Efficient File Analysis** - Only analyze when content changes
4. **Smart Standard Loading** - Load only relevant standards per request
