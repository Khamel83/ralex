# Ralex Project Documentation - Agent-OS Optimized

## Project Overview
Ralex is a terminal-native AI coding assistant that uses semantic routing to intelligently dispatch requests to appropriate LLM models via OpenRouter. It provides cost-effective, privacy-focused coding assistance with dynamic model selection.

**Enhanced with Agent-OS**: This project now uses Agent-OS for intelligent cost optimization and development workflow management, achieving **$50 worth of results for $1** using smart model routing.

## ðŸ’° Cost Optimization Strategy (Agent-OS Enhanced)
**Goal: Achieve $50 worth of results for $1 using smart model routing**

### Model Usage Pattern
1. **Planning Phase**: Use expensive models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for:
   - Architecture decisions
   - High-level problem solving
   - Complex reasoning tasks
   - Ralex component design

2. **Implementation Phase**: Use cheap models (Llama 3.1 8B) for:
   - Code generation from detailed specs
   - Repetitive tasks
   - Simple modifications
   - Ralex feature implementation

3. **Review Phase**: Use medium models (Claude Haiku) for:
   - Code review and debugging
   - Integration testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Ralex system validation

### Task Breakdown Approach
- Break complex Ralex development into micro-tasks
- Use cached solutions when possible
- Leverage Agent-OS templates and patterns
- Minimize expensive model usage

## Agent-OS Integration
- **Standards**: Follow `.agent-os/standards/` for coding practices
- **Workflows**: Use `.agent-os/workflows/` for development processes
- **Cost Templates**: Reference `.khamel83/cost-optimization/` for efficient task breakdown

## LiteLLM Routing
This project uses LiteLLM for intelligent model routing. Configuration in `.khamel83/model-routing/litellm-config.yaml`.

## Context Management
- Relevant files are in `.agent-os/` and `.khamel83/`
- Cache successful patterns in `.khamel83/cache/`
- Document cost savings in session logs

## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Khamel83/ralex.git
cd ralex
direnv allow  # Activates .envrc

# Or manual setup
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Running

#### Ralex V4 (Full Stack - Recommended)
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python start_ralex_v4.py
```
- **RalexBridge API**: http://localhost:8000
- **OpenWebUI Interface**: http://localhost:3000 (web interface - resource intensive on RPi)

## iOS Mobile Interface (Recommended for RPi)

For Raspberry Pi deployments, using an iOS app provides better performance than the web interface:

### Recommended iOS Apps (Best to Least)

#### 1. OpenCat (Best for Development)
- **Download**: [App Store - OpenCat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opencat-chat-with-ai-bot/id6445999201)
- **Setup**:
  1. Install OpenCat from App Store
  2. Open app â†’ Settings â†’ API Configuration
  3. Set Base URL: `http://192.168.7.197:8000/v1` (your RPi IP)
  4. API Key: Any value (Ralex doesn't require auth currently)
  5. Model: `ralex-bridge`
- **Why Best**: Developer-focused, keyboard extensions, prompt library, cross-device sync

#### 2. ChatBox AI (Excellent Alternative)
- **Download**: [chatboxai.app](https://chatboxai.app/en) â†’ iOS version
- **Setup**:
  1. Install ChatBox AI
  2. Settings â†’ Custom API Endpoint
  3. Endpoint: `http://192.168.7.197:8000`
  4. API Key: `ralex-key` (any value)
- **Why Good**: Team collaboration features, Azure endpoint support

#### 3. Pal Chat (Simple Option)
- **Download**: [App Store - Pal Chat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pal-chat-ai-chat-client/id6447545085)
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Pal Chat from App Store
  2. Settings â†’ Custom Server
  3. Base URL: `http://192.168.7.197:8000`
  4. API Key: Any value
- **Why Decent**: Clean interface, privacy-focused

### Network Access Notes
- Replace `192.168.7.197` with your actual Raspberry Pi IP address
- Ensure your iPhone is on the same network as your RPi
- For remote access, configure port forwarding or use Tailscale VPN

### Troubleshooting OpenCat Setup

**Connection Issues:**
1. **"Connection Failed"** - Check RPi IP address and port 8000 accessibility
2. **"Invalid API Key"** - Any value works, try "ralex-key"
3. **"Model Not Found"** - Ensure model is set to "ralex-bridge"
4. **Network timeout** - Verify RPi and iPhone on same WiFi network

**OpenCat Configuration Steps:**
1. Download OpenCat from App Store
2. Open OpenCat â†’ Settings â†’ API Configuration
3. Base URL: `http://[YOUR-RPI-IP]:8000/v1`
4. API Key: `ralex-key` (any value works)
5. Model: `ralex-bridge`
6. Test connection with simple query

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use OpenCat for mobile interaction
- Keep terminal for development tasks
- OpenWebUI on RPi is resource-intensive (use iOS instead)

**Development Workflow Integration:**
- OpenCat: General queries, code discussions, planning
- Terminal: File operations, git commands, testing
- Context flows between both interfaces via Ralex API

#### Legacy Ralex (V1-V3)
```bash
python -m ralex_core.launcher
```

### Testing
```bash
pytest  # Run tests
ruff check .  # Linting
black .  # Formatting
```

## Frontloading Execution Approvals

**Question**: Can we "frontload" all execution approvals to minimize user interruption?

**Analysis**: 
- Current architecture requires per-action approval for safety
- Possible approaches:
  1. Batch approval mode with upfront consent
  2. Trust levels based on action complexity
  3. Pre-approved action patterns
- Would require modifying executor base classes in `ralex_core/executors/`

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. Create comprehensive handover documentation
2. Research LiteLLM + AgentOS + OpenRouter alternative
3. Investigate frontloading execution approvals

### Medium Priority
4. Clean up tests to focus on current functionality
5. Update documentation to match current features
6. Set up automated formatting in CI/CD

### Low Priority
7. Document gemini-mcp-tool integration possibilities
