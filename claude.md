**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Qwen3 Coder (FREE)** is the new recommended default for Autopilot due to its strong performance in coding and tool-use, and its ability to create real files.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash (PAID)** offers excellent value for smart, context-aware tasks.
*   **DeepSeek R1 (FREE)** and the previous Autopilot configuration had persistent issues with tool calling.
*   All MCP integration tests failed due to the underlying model's tool-calling limitations.

**Next Steps (as per handover.md):**

1.  Default Autopilot model updated to Qwen3 Coder.
2.  Further investigation needed for DeepSeek R1's tool-calling issues.
3.  Explore more reliable tool-calling options.
4.  Refine MCP configuration and ensure proper integration.
5.  Implement continuous testing.
