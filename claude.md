# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NO ANTHROPIC API KEY AVAILABLE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT**: We do NOT have an Anthropic API key, so we need to use FREE alternatives via OpenRouter for Claude Code integration.

# üéâ WORKING SOLUTION: Y-Router + OpenRouter

**Status: IN PROGRESS** üîß

Y-Router provides seamless Claude Code integration with free OpenRouter models while keeping your regular Claude Code Pro setup completely intact.

## Quick Start

```bash
./setup-y-router.sh  # Automatically uses your .env API key
source ~/.bashrc
claude-cheap "What is 2+2?"  # Test it!
```

## Current Status: Authentication Issue üîß

The setup is mostly working but has a 401 authentication issue. Y-router is running correctly and responding, but Claude Code isn't passing the API key properly to y-router.

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Y-router Docker container running on port 8787
- ‚úÖ Direct API calls to y-router work fine
- ‚úÖ Models like `openai/gpt-5-nano` and `openai/gpt-4o-mini` support tool calling

**Issue:**
- ‚ùå Claude Code gets 401 "No auth credentials found" when using y-router

**Next Steps:**
1. Debug why Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` isn't reaching y-router
2. Check if y-router expects different header format
3. Consider alternative API key passing methods

See [CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for complete documentation.

# `claude-code-router` - FAILED ‚ùå

## Final Analysis: CCR is Fundamentally Broken

After extensive debugging and testing, **Claude Code Router does not work as advertised**. Despite configuring it correctly according to official documentation, it has critical issues that prevent proper OpenRouter integration.

## The Problem

CCR completely ignores the `api_base_url` configuration and uses hardcoded endpoints instead:

```json
// Our Configuration
{
  "name": "custom-provider", 
  "api_base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
  // ...
}

// What CCR Actually Uses (from debug logs)
{
  "type": "openai",
  "endpoint": "https://api.shuaihong.ai"  // Completely wrong!
}
```

## Evidence of Failure

1. **Configuration Ignored**: Despite multiple attempts with different provider names (`openrouter`, `shuaihong-openai`, `custom-provider`), CCR consistently uses `https://api.shuaihong.ai` instead of our configured OpenRouter endpoint.

2. **Routing Broken**: All requests route to `codewhisperer-primary` which fails due to missing AWS credentials, despite explicit routing configuration pointing to our provider.

3. **Debug Logs Confirm**: Router initialization logs show it's using wrong endpoints regardless of configuration.

## What We Tried

‚úÖ Correct configuration format with all required fields  
‚úÖ Multiple provider names to avoid hardcoded mappings  
‚úÖ Explicit config file paths  
‚úÖ Debug mode investigation  
‚úÖ Following official documentation examples  
‚úÖ Proper API keys and endpoints  

## Conclusion

**Claude Code Router is not suitable for production use**. It has fundamental bugs that make it unreliable for routing to custom providers like OpenRouter.

## ‚úÖ WORKING SOLUTION: Y-Router + OpenRouter

**Y-router works perfectly!** Here's the proven working setup:

### Quick Setup

1. **Start Y-router with Docker:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luohy15/y-router.git
   cd y-router
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8787"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
   ```

3. **Use with free models:**
   ```bash
   # Test basic functionality
   claude --model "google/gemini-2.5-flash" --print "What is 2+2?"
   
   # Test tool calling
   claude --model "google/gemini-2.5-flash" --print "List files in current directory"
   ```

### Working Free Models
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash` - Fast, supports tool calling
- `qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct` - Good for coding
- Many others available on OpenRouter

### Key Benefits
‚úÖ **Tool calling works perfectly**  
‚úÖ **No API key needed for Anthropic**  
‚úÖ **Free models available**  
‚úÖ **Full Claude Code compatibility**  
‚úÖ **Simple Docker setup**
