# Security Policy

## Overview

The K83 Framework takes security seriously. As a development orchestration tool that handles sensitive code, API keys, and development workflows, we implement comprehensive security measures to protect our users and their projects.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life    |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Full Support    | TBD            |
| 0.9.x   | ⚠️  Security Only   | 2025-06-01     |
| < 0.9   | ❌ Not Supported   | 2025-01-01     |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines:

**DO:**
- Report vulnerabilities privately first
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Work with us to verify the fix

**DON'T:**
- Publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they're fixed
- Test vulnerabilities on production systems you don't own
- Access or modify data that doesn't belong to you

### Reporting Process

#### 1. Initial Report

Send vulnerability reports to: **security@k83framework.com**

Include in your report:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: System details where you discovered the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

#### 2. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix Deployment**: Based on severity (see timeline below)
- **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after fix deployment (or by agreement)

#### 3. Severity Classification

| Severity | Timeline | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breach |
| **High** | 1 week | Authentication bypass, significant data exposure |
| **Medium** | 2 weeks | Limited data exposure, denial of service |
| **Low** | 1 month | Information disclosure, minor functionality issues |

### Bug Bounty Program

While we don't currently have a formal bug bounty program, we recognize and reward security researchers:

- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition in our security acknowledgments
- **Early Access**: Preview access to new features
- **Swag**: K83 Framework merchandise
- **Consultation**: Opportunity to provide feedback on security features

For critical vulnerabilities, we may provide monetary rewards on a case-by-case basis.

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

#### API Key Management

### Code Security

#### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before processing
- **Command Injection**: Protection against command injection attacks
- **Path Traversal**: Prevention of directory traversal vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries for database operations

#### Dependency Management
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Updates**: Prompt updates for security-related dependency updates
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface
- **License Compliance**: Verification of dependency licenses for compliance

### Access Control

#### File System
- **Permissions**: Appropriate file system permissions for all K83 files
- **Sandboxing**: Isolation of K83 processes where possible
- **Temporary Files**: Secure handling and cleanup of temporary files
- **Config Files**: Protection of configuration files containing sensitive data

#### Process Security
- **Privilege Separation**: Running with minimal necessary privileges
- **Environment Isolation**: Isolation between different project environments
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks
- **Process Monitoring**: Detection of unusual process behavior

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Always verify installation sources
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/k83/main/install-k83.sh | bash

# Or download and inspect first
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/k83/main/install-k83.sh > install-k83.sh
# Review the script content
bash install-k83.sh
```

#### API Key Management
```bash
# Use environment files (never commit)
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Use secure key storage when available
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=$(keychain-get api-key openrouter)
```

#### Project Security
```bash
# Regular security updates
./scripts/update-k83.sh

# Review generated code before committing
git diff --staged

# Use branch protection for important branches
git config branch.main.require-signature true
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated static analysis for security issues
