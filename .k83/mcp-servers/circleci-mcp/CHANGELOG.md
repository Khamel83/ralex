## [0.11.4] - 2025-07-28

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `get_flaky_tests` tool where unrelated tests were being returned
- Fixed bug in `get_flaky_tests` tool where if the output directory cannot be created the tool would respond with an error. We now throw in that case, which makes us fallback to the text output.

## [0.11.0] - 2025-06-18

### Added

- Added `USE_FILE_OUTPUT` environment variable to `get_flaky_tests` tool
  - When set to `true`, the tool will write flaky tests to files in the `./flaky-tests-output` directory instead of returning the results in the response
  - The tool will return the file paths of the written files in the response
