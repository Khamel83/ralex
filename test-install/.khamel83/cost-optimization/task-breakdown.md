# Task Breakdown Template

Use this template to break expensive tasks into cheap micro-tasks.

## Original Task
[Describe the complex task that would normally cost $50]

## Breakdown Strategy
1. **Planning Phase (Expensive Model)**
   - Architecture decisions
   - High-level approach
   - Risk assessment

2. **Implementation Phases (Cheap Models)**
   - [ ] Micro-task 1: [specific, small task]
   - [ ] Micro-task 2: [specific, small task]
   - [ ] Micro-task 3: [specific, small task]

3. **Review Phase (Medium Model)**
   - Integration testing
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimization

## Cost Estimate
- Planning: $1-2 (expensive model, short session)
- Implementation: $0.10-0.50 (cheap models, multiple tasks)
- Review: $0.25-0.50 (medium model, focused review)
- **Total: ~$1.50 instead of $50**
