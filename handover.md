# RalexOS Comprehensive Testing Handover

**Date:** August 12, 2025
**Objective:** Document the results of comprehensive testing of RalexOS OpenCode agent configurations, including model performance, MCP integration, and cost analysis.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The comprehensive testing revealed significant insights into the performance and capabilities of various OpenCode agent configurations. Qwen3 Coder (FREE) emerged as a star performer for coding and tool-use tasks, while Gemini 2.5 Flash (PAID) demonstrated excellent value with smart context awareness and fast responses. A critical issue was identified with DeepSeek R1 (FREE) and the default Autopilot mode, both exhibiting persistent "No endpoints found that support tool use" errors.

## 2. Detailed Test Results

### 2.1 Model Performance Overview

| Model                 | Type | Key Strengths                                  | Issues/Limitations                                  | Speed (Avg.) | Output Size (Avg.) |
| :-------------------- | :--- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :----------------- |
| **Qwen3 Coder**       | FREE | Excellent coding, tool use, detailed responses | Slower than other models                            | 20-40s       | 1000-2000 bytes    |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash**  | PAID | Smart, context-aware, fast, good quality       | None observed                                       | 5-10s        | 500-1000 bytes     |
| **DeepSeek R1**       | FREE | Fast                                           | Consistent "No tool use endpoints" errors           | 3s           | 320 bytes (error)  |
| **Autopilot (Default)** | N/A  | (Intended to be smart)                         | Inherits DeepSeek R1's tool use errors              | 2-7s         | 320 bytes (error)  |

### 2.2 Specific Test Scenarios & Observations

#### Basic Functionality Tests

*   **"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial..."**
    *   **Qwen3 Coder (FREE):** Successfully wrote `factorial.py` with iterative and recursive functions, error handling, and test code. Demonstrated actual file creation and detailed explanation.
    *   **Gemini 2.5 Flash (PAID):** Showed context awareness by attempting to read `factorial.py` before writing, then added a `simple_factorial` function.
    *   **DeepSeek R1 (FREE) & Autopilot:** Failed with tool use errors.

*   **"Explain the difference between authentication and..."**
    *   **Qwen3 Coder (FREE):** Provided a concise and accurate explanation.
    *   **Gemini 2.5 Flash (PAID):** Provided a concise and accurate explanation.
    *   **DeepSeek R1 (FREE) & Autopilot:** Failed with tool use errors.

*   **"Create a simple HTML form with validation..."**
    *   **Qwen3 Coder (FREE):** Successfully created `contact-form.html` with validation, demonstrating `Glob` and `List` tool usage.
    *   **Gemini 2.5 Flash (PAID):** Showed safety measures by refusing to overwrite `contact-form.html` without reading first, indicating good adherence to safety protocols.
    *   **DeepSeek R1 (FREE) & Autopilot:** Failed with tool use errors.

#### MCP Integration Tests

All MCP integration tests (GitHub, Context7, Reddit, Puppeteer) failed for the "Autopilot with MCP" agent. This is directly attributable to the underlying DeepSeek R1 model's inability to support tool use via OpenRouter, as indicated by the consistent error messages.

## 3. Cost Analysis

| Model                 | Estimated Cost per Million Tokens | Actual Usage (Tokens) | Actual Cost (Estimated) |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Free models           | $0.00                             | Varied                | $0.00                   |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash      | ~$0.075                           | ~529                  | ~$0.00004               |
| GPT-4o Mini           | ~$0.15                            | (Not tested in this run) | $0.00                   |
| Qwen3 Coder (Paid)    | ~$0.20                            | (Not tested in this run) | $0.00                   |
| o1-mini               | ~$3.00                            | (Not tested in this run) | $0.00                   |
| GPT-5                 | ~$10-30                           | (Not tested in this run) | $0.00                   |

**Total Estimated Cost for this Test Run:** Under $0.05 (primarily from Gemini 2.5 Flash usage).

## 4. Recommendations & Next Steps

1.  **Change Default Autopilot Model:** Immediately update the default Autopilot agent to use `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free`. This will leverage a capable free model that supports tool calling and provides robust responses, significantly improving the default user experience. (Already implemented in `ralexos-complete.sh` and `opencode.json`).
2.  **Investigate DeepSeek R1 Tooling:** Further investigate why `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free` is reporting "No endpoints found that support tool use." If this is a persistent limitation, consider removing it from the primary lineup or clearly marking its limitations.
3.  **Explore More Tool-Calling Options:** Actively research and integrate other free or cost-effective models that reliably support tool calling to provide more robust options for various tasks.
4.  **Refine MCP Configuration:** Ensure the MCP server configurations are correctly integrated and tested with models that support tool calling.
5.  **Continuous Testing:** Implement automated continuous integration (CI) testing for OpenCode agent configurations to catch regressions and validate new model integrations.
